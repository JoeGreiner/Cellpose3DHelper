# Cellpose3DHelper

For debugging reasons. Basic utility scripts to take a annotated 3D volumes, extract XY, YZ, and XZ slices, and train/predict [cellpose](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io) based on that.

Very likely the [cellpose documentation](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a much better starting point than this repo :-)
